Tool holding insert for a Cricut Maker Electronic Die Cutter.  This insert helps organize and protect the extra blades.  The Cricut Maker is an electronic die cutter, but unlike most other models, this one can actively drive the rotation of the blade and has a 10x the cutting force of a typical cutter. 

This allow it to cut fabrics (with the included rotary blade) and thicker materials such as balsa wood (with the optional knife blade).
